Hello, I'm **Evan (Ping-Chen) Chiang**, a Ph.D. student in Earth Sciences at Indiana University Bloomington, working under the guidance of <a href="https://earth.indiana.edu/directory/faculty/johnson-kaj.html">Dr. Kaj Johnson</a>. My research focuses on **Geodesy**, **Geophysics**, and **Mathematical Modeling**, aiming to integrate geological data across multiple timescales to estimate the kinematics of crustal deformation in present-day tectonic settings.

Through my work, I seek to improve our understanding of tectonic processes and contribute to the development of more accurate models for **assessing earthquake hazards and risks**.

I'm excited to use this website to share my research and connect with others in the geoscience community. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
